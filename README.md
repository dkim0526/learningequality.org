This is the code for Learning Equality's homepage: [https://learningequality.org](https://learningequality.org)

## Environment Setup

1. Install requirements:
    - [install pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) if you don't have it already.
    - install [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/): `pip install virtualenvwrapper`

2. Get the codebase: `git clone git@github.com:fle-internal/fle-home.git`

3. Make a virtualenv to install dependencies:
    - `cd <dir_name>`
    - `mkvirtualenv <desired_virtualenv_name>`
    - *Linux users: To get the mkvirtualenv command to work, you may have to add: `source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh` to your .bashrc file (and restart bash). You may also have to run: `sudo apt-get install python-dev` in order to be able to use pip inside the virtualenv.

4. Install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

	- *Windows users: You may run into an error "Unable to find vcvarsall.bat" when trying to install Pillow. If this occurs, delete the Pillow requirement from requirements.txt and run `easy_install pillow` after all other requirements have installed.

5. Create a local_settings.py file as a sibling to the settings.py file. Inside, set DEBUG = True (so static files will load in dev mode).

6. Set up the database: `python manage.py syncdb --migrate`

6. Run the server: `python manage.py runserver`


Final notes:

* When you're done, you can cancel the virutalenv with the command:
`deactivate`
* The map requires certain data files to use, and you will get an error if you try and view it at /map/ because they haven't been included in the repo.
* The blog won't work until you add at least one post to it. (needs fixing up...)


## Dev
* Check out the Issues page for known issues.
* Use the Wiki for style guide references. If there are none there, it means Dylan was a little overzealous.
